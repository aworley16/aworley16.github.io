<p>Parallel computing has moved from being a niche
technology to underlying most computing activities,
 including multi-core processing, cloud, distributed,
 and GPU-accelerated computing. Traditional,

 Learning a broad-based skill set in parallel and distributed computing (PDC)
 within Computer Science is paramount.</p>
